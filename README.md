For formatting `prettier-plugin-tailwindcss` with Prettier is recommened

### Styling
As for styling, Tailwind CSS classes are the perferred ways, with @apply with Tailwind CSS if it is better suited in the case. If a specific style is desired use the Square Brackets syntax (example: `text-[#0d0073]` or `w-[calc(100%_+_5rem)]`). Only if the css rule is not included should normal CSS be used
